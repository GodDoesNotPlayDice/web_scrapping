Tell me, lawyer, who is gonna think about my children? Do you know what he answered? What do I know! Become his friend! You tell me, Mrs. Cecilia! This time it's a long thing for me, they gave him four years! Three years for mine and seven months. Now the judges have got worse, first for a little robbery they gave you a year. They don't care anymore. Stinky people, they got much worse. But it's because of the liberals! - My poor husband! - Because of the politicians! Madam. That's right! The politicians! With all the troubles poor people have they complicate things! To exacerbate the authorities. They want to make a revolution! The revolution to move the Pope from Rome to Piemonte! Good deal! They want to make war against the French, and they have a king who can't even speak Italian! - A French king! - Do you hear her? - A French king! - Do you hear her? She can't say it, you know? Ignore her! God forbid the Piemontesi people arrive the liberal lords would realize it They burn churches, they steal. Do you know what they do to the women? You wish! Finally you would find someone to calm you ugly toad! Oh, when you talk to me, you have to wash your mouth, you know? You are the ruin of Rome! If the Pope doesn't react, it's all you liberals' fault! Go to hell! - You really should clean your mouth! - Mrs. Teresa! What's wrong? Leave her alone, she talks nonsense! I know but she provokes me! All right, you're right, every time the same story! What are we doing? Shall we open now? No, no, let them wait. Mrs. Teresa? Mrs. Cecilia? My husband has been pardoned! He'll get out in a few days! Thank God! Now it's time, let's go! Come on let's go brides, come on! I'm happy, at least one who is reasonable! One who has requested the pardon! Come on, come on, let's go. Come on, let's go! Do not bother your mother now. Poor woman! - Yes, you're right Augusto, but I... - Shut up! Let's go! You all go! God this cough! Hello how are you? I'm like a Pope! My God! And Mariuccio? Mario is fine. I had thought about sending him to the country, for a month in Genzano, at least he's with your big brother He'll be better, he has more company. He'll eat better, don't you think it's a good idea? You look worn out, Teresa! I don't like it. Augusto, you must make me happy! You have to ask for a medical examination. In here, with your cough! What's wrong with you, it's not it's not a shame, love! It's your right! Teresa, do you remember? What should I remember? - How beautiful you were! - Stop it! I've never been beautiful! You were You were a queen! Yes, the Queen of wands! I hate this cough! This cough, this cough! I can no longer hear you coughing like this. Augustus, will the day come again, when we could live in peace, again? Teresa, but you know that sometimes I wake up at night, and it seems to me that it is morning. Like once, do you remember it? I always woke up first, and I started looking at you. You slept quietly, serene, you looked like a little girl! Then you opened your eyes too. Yes, and you started giving me hard time. And you "come on, it's late!" you said immediately, so I wouldn't look at you And we would get dressed in the dark, slowly. Not to wake Mario, he was little. And then at work, all day together, to work like hell! You always grudging, with your ideas in mind! And you always in love, that smile that you have only when you sleep. And that I'm the only one to know. Augusto, do we want to ask for this medical examination? Yes, yes. Good morning! - Good morning Mrs. Teresa! - Who is that? You don't know her? It's Teresa Parenti! From Viviani's woolen mill. - Ah! - Poor thing, her husband has been in jail for three years. - They have a little son! - Now I remember! Let's go for a run, come on, come on! No! Yes, yes. Palatine fortress guard, rogue brigand, when the Pope goes into the sedan, he feels like a king. And now it's up to me! Women, women! Women! Women! I sell and buy hair! Come here! Yes. Look at this stuff! But the hair must be seen loose! They also walk! Mrs. Maria? How much do you take for that lice of your daughter? Ugly son of a Swiss guard! Come on! Look at this stuff, isn't it beautiful? Well... One, two! What do you want mom! You shouldn't be out in the street! I do not like this game, you'll get hurt! Mario do not make me angry, walk! - Come on! - Walk home! Mario if you blind one eye, when you come home I'll fix it! I'm playing, mom! This little boy always wants to win! Where are you Mario? I'm here! Come on! Yes! Come on! - Let's go home! - Good morning! Good morning. Mario come home! How is Augusto? White and red, he looks like a spider, how can he be? He's in jail! Goodness Gracious! What should I say Mrs. Giovanna! I pity them because I'm Christian! But they looked for the misfortune! But why are they involved with the Piemontesi? How do you say, if everyone would mind their own business, the world would be happy! Right! You know what? Go to hell! Mario. What, mum! Mario, do not make me repeat again, come on let's go! Just a minute! No, no minute, come back home, let's go! Come on! Do not make me angry, Mario. Damn it! Oh, what are you doing? Did you move the fight? It's my turn! One two... Mario, now if you're sweaty, you don't know what I'll do! - Good morning don Aldo. - Mrs. Teresa, I mean, you can't see anything in these stairs! Praised be Jesus Christ! Always be praised! No, do not close the door, I'm waiting for my son! Take a seat. Take a seat. Your stairs become longer and longer! - Why? - Or my floor is getting shorter! - Take a seat, I'll be right back. - Thank you. - Take a seat. - Are you preparing something to eat? Right. Go ahead! I'll catch my breath and I'll leave. And what are you preparing? Water. I'm preparing water for chicory. Tonight we'll have bread and chicory. Refreshing! At least that's what they say. What doesn't kill you, makes you fat, Don Aldo! Chicory does not cost a thing! Well, it costs to pick it up at 5 in the morning! I, I've brought you this, this thing, this half caciotta cheese! For the child. A shepherd, brought me a whole one. - Oh yes? - Yes, by grace received! Ah! Yes, just two weeks ago, he introduces himself and tells me, Don Aldo, you must pray for me. But you have to pray a lot, because you are worthy, and the Eternal Father will not say no. I say, my son, what sins do you have on your conscience, speak, let it out! Open up. He says nothing. A desire for grace. If you ask the Eternal Father, he will not say no! So? So, a shepherd so confident, I did it! So, don Aldo? All right, all right. This morning he comes to church, he makes a mess he pulls me out of the confessional! Then I gave him the caciotta cheese! He began to kiss my hands! I say, calm down my son! I understood that you are happy, and I'm glad you're happy, but I mean so this prayer had come at the right time Yes. Yes. And since the Eternal Father could not say no to me then his mother-in-law got killed! This is the grace! And so now he has become the master of 22 more sheep! You understood? I understood! And what have you done? What was I supposed to do? I threw the cheese at him! Don Aldo, but what are you doing? Don Aldo, what are you doing? Do you want some anise with fresh water? Thank you. I'll rinse the glass. nice and fresh - Like chicory! - Come on! - 22 sheep! - Can you believe it? - Unbelievable! - No, no, it's enough! A little drink! sit down, keep me company. All right. I came, also to talk to you about something. You could earn some money. I wish! Vannutelli's butler is looking for people to do, some cleaning in the building, before the prince, comes back from the countryside, you understand? So I could refer you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Only, do not make me look bad. What do you mean look bad? Don't talk bad about anybody, be quiet. Because in that building, everyone thinks in one way! Hot-headed people like your husband are not so well regarded...got it? I got it, I got it! I'll shut up! If they do not provoke me! Because it's useless to delude ourselves, Don Aldo! We are marked! Everyone knows our ideas! Beautiful ideas! All right, don Aldo! Eh? Let's not go there, one more time. Wait a minute, sorry, Mrs. Teresa, if there was one who gave you a hand, not to reproach, for heaven's sake! He was a humble representative of the church. Not those with different ideas! But you are not a humble representative of the church! - No? - No. And who would I be? You are Don Aldo. Have you seen Augusto? I've been there, I've been there. Oh yes? Did you tell him that his Piemontesi arrested Mazzini? And have exiled his beloved Garibaldi to Caprera? - Did you tell him? - No. I did not tell him. And you made a mistake. Because if you want him to understand, and decide to sign the request for pardon you must tell him these things, Teresa because they are true! They're real! And Augusto must open his eyes! You believed in it. You believed in it. You believed in Mazzini, Garibaldi. At this time you were... You make me ramble. You believed, in the unity of Italy! Alright then. You have believed so much, that now the poor Augusto is in jail! And it's been three years! But now you see it too, what happens in Rome! No one believes in it anymore here in Rome! And those few, perhaps, perhaps I say, still believe in it, at least they have learned to be smart! And they are holed up in their warm homes! Eh! You have to make it clear to that crazy head of Augusto how things really are! No more chit-chat. His king has put Mazzini in jail! His king shot Garibaldi! Shut up! The Roman liberals, they are on a full stomach, they make the sign of the cross and go in procession, my dear! They understood! And Augusto Parenti cracks in jail! Augusto Parenti has his own ideas. he doesn't want to dirty his hands by signing the request of pardon to the Pope Don Aldo! You're stubborn, Teresa! - Stubborn! - Maybe! Yes. This isn't heroism, your poor husband, is a deluded, irresponsible fool! And selfish! Yes, because one who has a wife and children! Don Aldo, please. I did not ask you anything, therefore, you came here to lecture me? Sorry, no it's not that, you see, I wanted to explain my position to you. Because it's not that, imagine if a priest like me. Imagine. No, I mean. I have always spoken fondly with you, let's say so. You would be a perfect family if politics were not involved. I don't want to be preachy but I want to tell you. - Well... - Mum. - What did you do? - Mariuccio. - And what have you done! - Look at you, I knew it! I've been calling you for two hours. What have you done? Show me! What a bump, look at this! What did you do? What did you do there? Nothing, that son of... The son of the greengrocer in Via dei Capettari! It's a scratch, ouch you hurt me! But how many times have I told you Mario come up, Mario come up, Mario come up. What should I do to you now, eh? Nothing. I do not know. You tell me don Aldo, what am I to do with this son of... Oh well, it's gonna be my fault, I know! We need the stick, the stick! - Like I didn't have enough! - What are you doing? I know what I should do with you! Quiet, you idiot. Now you got a bump! You didn't listen, see? What does the fourth commandment say, do you remember? The fourth, come on! Fourth. honor, honor thy father, the father, mom, how is dad? He's fine, he sends his love. - Quiet now. - Take it. This is St. Agnes, It's miraculous, you know? Now you go there, you lie down on the bed and you put it on the scratch! You'll see that it will be better than the knife, the wraps, everything. - See how beautiful she is! - Little boy? Come on, take Saint Agnese, you put it on the bump and everything is finished! Well! Poor son, what can he do! All day alone, always thrown in the middle of the road. - It's not his fault! - Don Aldo? Shall we start with the story of the seminar, again? - No, for heaven's sake! - Come on. It's just that if I were you, I would think about it seriously. Why are you saying that? To enter the seminary, it takes a calling, doesn't it? Oh sure! - Mario, he is the son of his father! But the calling is a secondary thing! I mean, I mean that in the seminary, the child would be guarded, fed, dressed! And he would study! The calling will come later. And if it were to come, then it will mean that that was God's will! If instead it does not come, even in this case, it would always be God's will, always! Am I clear? The church doesn't wish to have the wrong priest! Eh! If he doesn't become priest it's fine! But in the meantime the study will have opened his mind, understood? And tomorrow, being clean, shod and dressed, will be respected by everyone, because only education, makes you earn respect! He could face life, with clearer ideas! Educated. Prepared. Eh? Think about it Teresa! Think about it! Also for the sake of Augusto. Yes. Because with the child in the seminary, I think, it will be easier, won't it? Find a good word, support, authority. I say yes, though, even in case who is gonna tell him? He's capable of anything! But sorry, Teresa, but why do you have to tell him? Not right away maybe later. Mariuccio. Mariuccio. Did you understand? It's something like that, it's like going to school. Yes, but dressed as a priest. What does it mean, what does it mean! It's how Mum says, the seminar is like a school, a kind of college. Of the priests. All right it's a college of priests. We do not like priests in my house. Mario? He has nothing to do with it! And yes I know, I'm not a priest, I'm Don Aldo. All right, anyway, kid, if you do not stop messing up this poor woman, one day I'll...it's a shame! Even mom has my same ideas. - Mario! - Shut up, You should thank God from morning to night! Yes, because it was him it is through the intercession of our Lord, do you understand? Yes sir, did you understand? Our Lord has given us the grace to enter here, do you understand? Here you can become someone, and help your mother, right? When you get out of here you'll be somebody else! A priest. Somebody else! Little boy, you're not stupid, you must understand me! We are talking about your future, we are not playing around! But I mean... Here are many kids of your age, Mario! You will have many friends, you will learn many things. Mariuccio, you must be good. You must love me, you have to help me. You think I'm happy, that I had to send you here? Mario! I'll be alone. - But I wanted to... - What? Anyway, if it's for your own good Mum is happy too, did you understand, love? But when are you coming? This will also depend on you, right? Be patient. If you are good, if you are obedient if you behave as you should mom can come often, almost always, right? Don Aldo. Ah it's him. here we are! Are you Mario Parenti? - Yes. - Welcome! Sorry. Bye, sweetheart. But are you coming on Sunday? No this one, the other one I'll come. But look, they make me come only if you are good, understood love? Come soon mum. Hey! Keep it, come on! - Shall we go? - Yes. It won't last, he'll run away! No! He won't run away. Yes, he will! Mrs. Teresa, are you crying? but do not worry, it will be like home. He will study He will have a life! As you say! So, Mario? You are the youngest here! You're happy? Mario! You must reply! You must learn to answer! Don't worry! It's nothing! Do you see what I'm doing now? I'm doing a nice little thing! Easy. You'll see, you'll see! Dario come here! Vittorio! Four, five! Done. Did I hurt you? It was nothing, I told you so! Keep it, bring it to your mother, keep it as a souvenir. And do you know what we do now? I'll cut it all, so you're like the others! Come on. Mario! You're so good! There it is! A little bit more. This passage we will read now is the parable, of the father of a family, from the Gospel of St. Matthew. At that time, Jesus explained this parable, to his disciples. In the kingdom of Heaven, a father went out early in the morning, to find works for his vineyard. And after discussing the daily pay for his workers he sent them to his vineyard. Outside on the third hour, he saw the others standing idle in the square. And he said to them: "you too go to my vineyard and I will give you what will be right!" - Will you give me that? - but what do you want, this is mine! Come on! Come on! On the sixth and ninth hour, Just a little thing! Silence. - What did I do? - Shut up! He found others who were there and he asked them: They answered And he says: . In the evening, the owner of the vineyard, told the farmer:
